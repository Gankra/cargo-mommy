If you try to make it into an alias, you should prefere poiting it to `cargo-mommy` directly,
we wouldn't want to break rustup toolchain picker, now would we?~

# Configuration

Mommy will read the following environment variables to make her messages better for you~ ❤️

* `CARGO_MOMMYS_LITTLE` - what to call you~ (default: "girl")
* `CARGO_MOMMYS_PRONOUNS` - what pronouns mommy will use for themself~ (default: "her")
* `CARGO_MOMMYS_ROLES` - what role mommy will have~ (default "mommy")

All of these options can take a `/` separated list. Mommy will randomly select one of them whenever she talks to you~

For example, the phrase "mommy loves her little girl~ ❤️" is "CARGO_MOMMYS_ROLE loves CARGO_MOMMYS_PRONOUNS little CARGO_MOMMYS_LITTLE~ ❤️"

So if you set `CARGO_MOMMYS_ROLES="daddy"`, `CARGO_MOMMYS_PRONOUNS="his/their"`, and `CARGO_MOMMYS_LITTLE="boy/pet/baby"` then you might get any of

* daddy loves their little boy~ ❤️
* daddy loves his little pet~ ❤️
* daddy loves their little baby~ ❤️

And so on~ ❤️
