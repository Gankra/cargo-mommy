# Guides

These guides are intended to help folks setup cargo-mommy in situations like these ones~

* [persistent bash config](./bash.md)
* [persistent powershell config](./powershell.md)
* [ci scripting](./ci.md)
* the rust build system (x.py)
* using cargo-mommy for other non-cargo-mommy commands (CARGO_MOMMYS_ACTUAL)
* fish
* zsh
* nix
* ...?

Please contribute any knowledge you have about these setups so everyone can enjoy~
