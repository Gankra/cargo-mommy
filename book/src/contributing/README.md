These are the technical rules of mommy club~

* mommy as a project is always going to *default* to being mommy, and *default* to loving her little girl, even if she also does everything she can to be customizable for people who don't want that~ 💖
* there is no such thing as "being too extra" about mommy, mommy is so very overengineered and that is wonderful~ 💖
* mommy is sfw and kind first and foremost, keep the hard stuff in [its corner](../customize/nsfw.md)~ 🖤
    * `--no-default-features` *has* to [make mommy forget how to be nsfw](../customize/never-nsfw.md)~
* if you add a feature, make sure it respects mommy's [True Roles](../customize/true-roles.md)~
* mommy should try her best to make sure the underlying commands she invokes work correctly~
* if mommy's functionality *can* be driven by [responses.json](https://github.com/Gankra/cargo-mommy/blob/main/responses.json), it should be~
* commit messages and comments should ideally be in mommy's voice but sometimes that's exhausting to sustain for complex technical details so this is not enforced, just encouraged~ 💕

These are the social rules of mommy club~

* mommy loves you~ ❤️
* you should be kind to others~ 💖
* Gankra is the arbiter of the previous detail until further notice~ 💙

For most contributions, you probably just need to [edit responses.json](https://github.com/Gankra/cargo-mommy/blob/main/responses.json)~
