# Adding New Messages

If you want to add a new message to an existing mood, all you need to do is edit [repsonses.json](https://github.com/Gankra/cargo-mommy/blob/main/responses.json) and add the string! See [the concepts docs for details on the format](./concepts.md)~

That's it, no code or docs needs to be changed~ ðŸ’•
