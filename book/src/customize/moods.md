# Moods

Moods are a system for changing the flavour/vibe of mommy's messages~ 💕

Here's the moods mommy can have~

* chill: encouragement and support from mommy~ 💕
* ominous: mommy thinks you should prepare for the coming prophecy~ 💜

See [the NSFW docs for additional spicier moods](./nsfw.md#moods)~

By default only the "chill" mood is enabled. The moods mommy can select from are chosen by the `CARGO_MOMMYS_MOODS` environment variable, using [ISO Standard Pronoun Syntax](./roles-and-pronouns.md) (e.g. `CARGO_MOMMYS_MOODS="chill/ominous"` turns both of those moods on).
